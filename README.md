# Heart Disease Dashboard Analysis Using Power BI

## Project Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of heart disease data, focusing on survival trends, vital biomarkers, and risk factors across different age groups. The primary goal is to leverage Power BI for actionable insights that can inform healthcare strategies.

## Key Features:
- Survival metrics across age groups to highlight resilience and trends.
- Analysis of biomarkers like serum creatinine and ejection fraction to understand physiological stability.
- Sankey diagram illustrating the flow of risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure across age groups.
- Visualizations and findings summarized in an attached PowerPoint presentation.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Power BI:** For creating and visualizing the heart disease dashboard.
- **Data Analysis:** Advanced metrics and correlations to extract actionable insights.

## Repository Contents:
- `Heart_Disease_Dataset.xlsx` - The excel file containing the heart disease Clean Data.
- `HeartDiseaseAnalysis.pptx` - A concise PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key findings of this project.
- `README.md` - Documentation describing the project, features, and repository structure.

## Insights & Applications:
- Highlights the importance of early preventive care for younger age groups and risk management strategies for older groups.
- Provides a foundation for future healthcare improvements and predictive modeling.
